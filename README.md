# Bilibili Comments Crawler

A tiny web crawler for [bilibili](https://www.bilibli.com) video comments based on asyncio. Using [requests](https://github.com/requests/requests), [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) and [SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/zzzeek/sqlalchemy) (not yet). 

This version just makes the basic functionality work. Not reliable.

Usage:

1. `pip install -r requirements`
2. `python crawler av23333`

Seek in `python crawler -h` for more information.
