# Bilibili Comments Clawer

A tiny web clawer for [bilibili](https://www.bilibli.com) video comments based on asyncio. Using [requests](https://github.com/requests/requests), [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) and [SQLAlchemy](https://github.com/zzzeek/sqlalchemy) (not yet). 

This version just makes the basic functionality work. Not reliable.

Usage:

1. `pip install -r requirements`
2. `python clawer av23333`

Seek in python clawer -h for more information.
